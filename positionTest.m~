%% Okay, we want to find out who has been staying for some time at the Beer garden. How to do it?

% Beer gardens position:
% 21,33

% Search all data and save those who have movement data that is more than
% one at 21,33
parkmap = imread('Auxiliary Files/Park Map.jpg');
M = friday;
sortedM = sortrows(M, 2);

q = sortedM(sortedM.type == "movement",:);
c = q(q.(4) == 21,:);
c = c(c.(5) == 33,:);

beerGardenPeople = unique(c.(2));       % they have been at the beerGarden
                                        % now we need to filter out those
                                        % who have stayed there a longer
                                        % time

BGPeople = table;
%it has an id, and for how many recorded slots it has been at the garden
BGId = beerGardenPeople(1);

BGPeople.id = BGId;
counter = 1;

% loop through c (with help from BeerGardenPeople
[BGPsize, ~] = size(beerGardenPeople);
for i = 2:BGPsize

    % fetch the id
    tempID = beerGardenPeople(i);
    
    if tempID ~= BGId

    % look at how many
